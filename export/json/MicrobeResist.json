      "body_html": "<p>Hi Jesse,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks for reading the proposal and taking the time to comment on it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>I provided the two offline reviewers' comments in the spirit of openness. Typically I will have several people read a proposal before it is submitted as I did here. In this case, I have provided the initial first draft of the proposal, so there are some simple things that should be corrected. In fact, I have already started to revise the proposal based on these comments. But I'm not sure how to revise it online without changing the original document. It seems like it would be useful to have different versions of the proposal to see how it changes in response to these discussions. Or maybe I am missing how to do this? Also I wasn't sure if I should change it while some of you are reading the current version. So for now I have let the first draft online as it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I wrote the somewhat careless statement that \"This study will help in the development of strategies to manage the development of antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance in an intensive housing environment,\" this is what I was thinking about. If we find evidence for resistance genes that are associated with disinfectants that are commonly used in the animal shelter environment (and also genes for antibiotic resistance), this background information will be very informative in guiding future studies to develop specific strategies to manage the development of such resistance in bacterial communities that reside on surfaces in animal shelters. I have some specific ideas for this but they are a bit beyond the scope of this project. In any case, I have already revised this statement (and the similar one later in the proposal) offline but await further input before I upload a revised version of the proposal. In addition, it is clarifying for me to see how different people respond to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can use bacterial source tracking to identify potential sources for some of the surface communities based on the many available reference collections for soil, air, water, human and animal associated communities. I did not propose collecting additional samples for that purpose here due to the limited level of funding for this project. But we can use publicly available data to begin to address potential sources. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why do we want to identify the biogeography of bacteria in buildings? This is something that is not always clear to people who are not ecologists. Microbial ecologists believe that we need to understand what is there and how diversity varies across these environments before we can understand how such communities might change in response to environmental variation or potential interventions, such as a new approach to ventilation or disinfection. In addition to who is there, the traits exhibited by these communities can be of interest, i.e., resistance genes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This study is not designed to compare different disinfection strategies in the different kennels.

      "body_md": "Hi Jesse,\r\n\r\nThanks for reading the proposal and taking the time to comment on it. \r\n\r\nI provided the two offline reviewers' comments in the spirit of openness. Typically I will have several people read a proposal before it is submitted as I did here. In this case, I have provided the initial first draft of the proposal, so there are some simple things that should be corrected. In fact, I have already started to revise the proposal based on these comments. But I'm not sure how to revise it online without changing the original document. It seems like it would be useful to have different versions of the proposal to see how it changes in response to these discussions. Or maybe I am missing how to do this? Also I wasn't sure if I should change it while some of you are reading the current version. So for now I have let the first draft online as it is.\r\n\r\nWhen I wrote the somewhat careless statement that \"This study will help in the development of strategies to manage the development of antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance in an intensive housing environment,\" this is what I was thinking about. If we find evidence for resistance genes that are associated with disinfectants that are commonly used in the animal shelter environment (and also genes for antibiotic resistance), this background information will be very informative in guiding future studies to develop specific strategies to manage the development of such resistance in bacterial communities that reside on surfaces in animal shelters. I have some specific ideas for this but they are a bit beyond the scope of this project. In any case, I have already revised this statement (and the similar one later in the proposal) offline but await further input before I upload a revised version of the proposal. In addition, it is clarifying for me to see how different people respond to it.\r\n\r\nWe can use bacterial source tracking to identify potential sources for some of the surface communities based on the many available reference collections for soil, air, water, human and animal associated communities. I did not propose collecting additional samples for that purpose here due to the limited level of funding for this project. But we can use publicly available data to begin to address potential sources. \r\n\r\nWhy do we want to identify the biogeography of bacteria in buildings? This is something that is not always clear to people who are not ecologists. Microbial ecologists believe that we need to understand what is there and how diversity varies across these environments before we can understand how such communities might change in response to environmental variation or potential interventions, such as a new approach to ventilation or disinfection. In addition to who is there, the traits exhibited by these communities can be of interest, i.e., resistance genes.\r\n\r\nThis study is not designed to compare different disinfection strategies in the different kennels. Instead it is designed to characterize the communities found living on surfaces in the dog housing area. It is designed to capture the range of variation in the dog kennels, which do differ in amount of light, humidity and proximity to windows and exits. I would also like to use data loggers to measure the amount of variation in temperature and humidity in the kennels.\r\n\r\nThis pilot study is not funded at a level to allow for comparisons of multiple shelters with different strategies.

Animal shelter housing typically has high occupancy of highly stressed, potentially immunosuppressed animals. Consequently disease transmission is a major concern. To protect both animal and human health, animals are vaccinated and treated with antibiotics; additionally most animal housing units are cleaned daily with disinfectants. The use of antibiotics and disinfectants may promote the spread of resistance traits in resident bacterial populations. Here we propose a study to characterize bacterial and fungal community composition and the presence of antibiotic and disinfectant resistance genes in the microbiota residing on surfaces in an animal shelter.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1 id=\"objectives\">Objectives</h1>\r\n\r\n<ol><li><p>We will use amplicon sequencing to characterize the composition of bacterial and fungal communities occurring on surfaces in an animal shelter. By identifying what bacteria and fungi occur here, we can begin to understand sources for these communities (such as animal host, soil, air, water) and identify potential effects that different environmental factors may have on microbial persistence in these building reservoirs (such as use of disinfectants, proximity to windows, moisture, sunlight). These findings can help to inform practices within animal shelters such as the use of ventilation and disinfectants to protect animal health.</p></li><li><p>We will use metagenomic sequencing to identify the presence of genes associated with antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance as well as biofilm formation in these communities. This part of the study provides an important link between describing what microbes are present on building surfaces and identifying what traits might help them to persist in such relatively extreme environments. This study will help in the development of strategies to manage the development of antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance in an intensive housing environment.</p></li></ol>\r\n\r\n<h1 id=\"background\">Background</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Animal shelters house a high density of stressed animals, providing the opportunity for the emergence and transmission of infectious diseases <span class=\"citation\">[<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0300985813511129\" class=\"citation\" data-key=\"10.1177/0300985813511129\">1</a>]</span>. The US Humane Society estimates that between 6 and 8 million companion animals enter animal shelters in the United States each year.

The dog holding area contains 52 individual indoor single compartment kennels, 80&#8221; long x 40&#8221; wide x 80&#8221; high. Kennel floors are concrete and walls are ceramic tile covered with concrete block. Kennels are arranged linearly with one central aisle and 2 side aisles. The ventilation system draws air from the outside into the the holding area and exhaust is pulled out by ceiling fans. The kennel also has open windows and doors in summer. Dogs brought into the shelter are subject to a five day holding period and during this period they cannot be walked. Each kennel is cleaned daily to remove animal waste with accelerated hydrogen peroxide sprayed by a pressure washer. \t</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will collect surface samples from throughout the dog holding area. Surface samples will be collected from the floors, walls and ledges using a 10cm x 10cm grid and sterile, dry cotton swabs (Puritan brand). We collect three samples from each kennel (52 kennels x 3 surfaces = 156 samples). We will record whether a kennel was currently occupied. We will also collect samples from the walkways, drainage system, window ledges and outside each entrance to the dog holding area. Samples will be stored at -80 &#176;C until DNA is extracted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DNA will be extracted using MoBio PowerSoil kits with an additional lysis step to maximize extraction efficiency for low biomass, swab samples. We will use sterile scissors to cut the cotton head of the swab directly into provided PowerBead tubes containing solution C1. The tubes will be incubated at 65 &#176;C for 10 minutes and vortexed horizontally for 10 minutes. Subsequently, we will follow the standard kit protocol. DNA samples will be stored at -80&#176;C prior to preparing Illumina libraries for sequencing. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>DNA isolated from surface samples will be characterized for bacterial diversity based on phylogenetically informative markers in the V4 region of 16S rRNA following the methods of <span class=\"citation\">[<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.f.303\" class=\"citation\" data-key=\"10.1038/nmeth.f.303\">16</a>]</span>.

Samples will be sequenced in multiplexed Illumina MiSeq lanes (using paired-end 250 base pair sequencing). Sequence data will be entered into the standard Quantitative Insights in Microbial Ecology (QIIME 1.5.0) workflow. Each sample will be characterized for taxonomic composition (number and abundance). For presence/absence analyses, representative operational taxonomic units (OTUs) will be clustered at the &gt;97% identity level and an OTU table will be constructed using QIIME&#8217;s pick_otus_through_otu_table.py script. We will compare beta diversity using Fast UniFrac scores <span class=\"citation\">[<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2009.97\" class=\"citation\" data-key=\"10.1038/ismej.2009.97\">18</a>]</span> visualized with principle coordinates analysis.

      "body_md": "# Abstract\r\n\r\nEach year animal shelters provide essential care for millions of animals, many of which enter the shelter without receiving any prior veterinary care. Animal shelter housing typically has high occupancy of highly stressed, potentially immunosuppressed animals. Consequently disease transmission is a major concern. To protect both animal and human health, animals are vaccinated and treated with antibiotics; additionally most animal housing units are cleaned daily with disinfectants. The use of antibiotics and disinfectants may promote the spread of resistance traits in resident bacterial populations. Here we propose a study to characterize bacterial and fungal community composition and the presence of antibiotic and disinfectant resistance genes in the microbiota residing on surfaces in an animal shelter.\r\n\r\n# Objectives\r\n\r\n1. We will use amplicon sequencing to characterize the composition of bacterial and fungal communities occurring on surfaces in an animal shelter. By identifying what bacteria and fungi occur here, we can begin to understand sources for these communities (such as animal host, soil, air, water) and identify potential effects that different environmental factors may have on microbial persistence in these building reservoirs (such as use of disinfectants, proximity to windows, moisture, sunlight). These findings can help to inform practices within animal shelters such as the use of ventilation and disinfectants to protect animal health.\r\n\r\n2. We will use metagenomic sequencing to identify the presence of genes associated with antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance as well as biofilm formation in these communities. This part of the study provides an important link between describing what microbes are present on building surfaces and identifying what traits might help them to persist in such relatively extreme environments. This study will help in the development of strategies to manage the development of antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance in an intensive housing environment.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nAnimal shelters house a high density of stressed animals, providing the opportunity for the emergence and transmission of infectious diseases [@10.1177/0300985813511129]. The US Humane Society estimates that between 6 and 8 million companion animals enter animal shelters in the United States each year. Many of these animals have not received any prior veterinary care or vaccination. Numerous pathogens occur in the animal shelter environment, including beta-hemolytic Streptococci, feline herpesvirus I, canine distemper virus, canine influenza virus, feline calicivirus, parvoviruses and feline infectious peritonitis  [@10.1177/0300985813511129]. Fungal infections such as ringworm are also of major concern [@10.1016/j.prevetmed.2010.11.001]. To minimize disease outbreaks in this intensive housing environment, shelter staff use vaccination, antibiotics and disinfectants to protect both animal and human health.\r\n\r\nThe widespread use of antimicrobial products is accelerating the spread of antibiotic and antimicrobial resistance. Drug resistant bacterial strains have been identified in animal shelters: bacteria with multidrug resistance were isolated from both dog kennels [@10.1016/j.theriogenology.2012.05.033] and cat housing areas [@10.1016/j.rvsc.2005.10.004]. Increased biocide resistance may cause increased antibiotic resistance because resistance genes can be located in close proximity and can share common resistance mechanisms (e.g., [@10.1128/AAC.45.2.428-432.2001], [@10.1046/j.1365-2672.92.5s1.4.x], [@10.1016/j.tim.2006.02.006], [@10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.02.014], [@10.1128/AAC.49.1.454-456.2005]). Furthermore, antibiotic resistance can be transmitted from animals treated with antibiotics to humans working in close proximity to them [@10.1089/fpd.2006.0066].  \r\n\r\nShelter animals and staff may acquire drug resistant bacterial strains in shelters and carry them into local communities. According to the ASPCA about 2.7 million companion animals are adopted from shelters each year. Many people live in close contact with their pets; studies of dog owners found that they share both gastrointestinal bacteria [@10.1017/S0022172400064597] and skin bacteria [@10.7554/eLife.00458] with their dogs. Our pets harbor and shed diverse microbial communities that may shape the microbial composition of their human companions [@10.7554/eLife.00458] through both direct and indirect contact. Although most research has focused on the effects of human occupancy in buildings, animal skin, hair, fecal material, saliva and ectoparasites such as fleas and mites are likely to contribute significantly to the microbial communities associated with indoor surfaces and air [@10.1111/j.1365-2222.1994.tb03323.x], [@10.1016/j.jaci.2010.05.042], [@10.1186/gb-2013-14-2-202]. \r\n\r\nHere we propose a pilot study to characterize the microbial communities occurring on surfaces in an animal shelter. First we will use phylogenetically informative markers to characterize the diversity of bacteria and fungi occurring in these samples. Then we will sequence the metagenome for a subset of these samples to identify genes that may promote persistence in this environment, including those that affect the ability to form biofilms to colonize surfaces, such as amyloid fibers called curli promote adhesion on surfaces and human epithelial cells (found in Enterbacteriaceae), as well as resistance to antimicrobial disinfectants and antibiotics. \r\n\r\n# Research Plan\r\n\r\nWe will focus on the holding area for dogs in an open intake municipal animal shelter. The dog holding area contains 52 individual indoor single compartment kennels, 80” long x 40” wide x 80” high. Kennel floors are concrete and walls are ceramic tile covered with concrete block. Kennels are arranged linearly with one central aisle and 2 side aisles. The ventilation system draws air from the outside into the the holding area and exhaust is pulled out by ceiling fans. The kennel also has open windows and doors in summer. Dogs brought into the shelter are subject to a five day holding period and during this period they cannot be walked. Each kennel is cleaned daily to remove animal waste with accelerated hydrogen peroxide sprayed by a pressure washer. \t\r\n\r\nWe will collect surface samples from throughout the dog holding area. Surface samples will be collected from the floors, walls and ledges using a 10cm x 10cm grid and sterile, dry cotton swabs (Puritan brand). We collect three samples from each kennel (52 kennels x 3 surfaces = 156 samples). We will record whether a kennel was currently occupied. We will also collect samples from the walkways, drainage system, window ledges and outside each entrance to the dog holding area. Samples will be stored at -80 °C until DNA is extracted.\r\n\r\nDNA will be extracted using MoBio PowerSoil kits with an additional lysis step to maximize extraction efficiency for low biomass, swab samples. We will use sterile scissors to cut the cotton head of the swab directly into provided PowerBead tubes containing solution C1. The tubes will be incubated at 65 °C for 10 minutes and vortexed horizontally for 10 minutes. Subsequently, we will follow the standard kit protocol. DNA samples will be stored at -80°C prior to preparing Illumina libraries for sequencing. \r\n\r\nDNA isolated from surface samples will be characterized for bacterial diversity based on phylogenetically informative markers in the V4 region of 16S rRNA following the methods of [@10.1038/nmeth.f.303]. Fungal diversity will be characterized using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region 1 of the nuclear ribosomal coding cistron [@10.1073/pnas.1117018109]. Samples will be sequenced in multiplexed Illumina MiSeq lanes (using paired-end 250 base pair sequencing). Sequence data will be entered into the standard Quantitative Insights in Microbial Ecology (QIIME 1.5.0) workflow. Each sample will be characterized for taxonomic composition (number and abundance). For presence/absence analyses, representative operational taxonomic units (OTUs) will be clustered at the >97% identity level and an OTU table will be constructed using QIIME’s pick_otus_through_otu_table.py script. We will compare beta diversity using Fast UniFrac scores [@10.1038/ismej.2009.97] visualized with principle coordinates analysis. We will compare the temporal sequence of establishment in each kitten and assess temporal changes in microbiome diversity using various nonparametric multivariate methods, discriminant function analysis and association networks. We will use SourceTracker [@10.1038/nmeth.1650] to identify potential sources of bacteria by comparing bacterial OTUs identified in samples from outside, soil, canine and human. \r\n\r\nWe will sequence the metagenome for a subset of these samples to detect antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance in bacteria occurring on surfaces in the animal shelter environment. Because we expect to have a low amount of input DNA for each sample, we will use the Illumina Nextera XT library preparation kit. We will select, label with barcodes and pool up to 24 samples for sequencing. We will use PhyloSift [@10.7717/peerj.243] to perform phylogeny-driven Bayesian hypothesis tests for the presence of bacteria, fungi, viruses and other organisms occurring in these samples. The BacMet database for antibacterial biocide and metal resistance genes will be used to screen our metagenomic data for resistance genes as well as genes associated with biofilm formation [@10.1093/nar/gkt1252].\r\n\r\n# Team & Resources\r\n\r\nJonathan Eisen, Primary Investigator, is an expert in microbial genomics and an advocate for open science.\r\nHolly Ganz, Project Scientist, is a microbial ecologist, who uses genetic and statistical methods to characterize the diversity of microorganisms that live in the environment and in association with plants and animals.
