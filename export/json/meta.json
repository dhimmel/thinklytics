This would happen when a rating is given that is lower than the comment's average rating. I suspect from a gamification perspective this is quite bad. One way we can mitigate this is to put a damper on points earned when just one or two people have submitted ratings. So two ratings of 10 would result in more points than just one rating of 10. And a rating of 10 followed by a rating of 5 would result in less of a reduction of points than it would otherwise. Combining this functionality with daily updates should significantly reduce the likelihood of a users's impact points  progressing backwards. The reason is that the effect of any one rating will be averaged in with the effects of all other ratings that occur in that 24 hour period.

One interesting aspect of the current system is that it's possible for a user's impact points and *unconfirmed* earnings to go *down*. This would happen when a rating is given that is lower than the comment's average rating. I suspect from a gamification perspective this is quite bad. One way we can mitigate this is to put a damper on points earned when just one or two people have submitted ratings. So two ratings of 10 would result in more points than just one rating of 10. And a rating of 10 followed by a rating of 5 would result in less of a reduction of points than it would otherwise. Combining this functionality with daily updates should significantly reduce the likelihood of a users's impact points  progressing backwards. The reason is that the effect of any one rating will be averaged in with the effects of all other ratings that occur in that 24 hour period. And any rating should, on average, increase points scored (because of the damper I mentioned).\r\n3. Finally, since peer ratings will not provide \"instant\" gratification anyway, it's probably not that big of a deal to just do the updates daily.\r\n\r\n# Inspiring confidence in new users\r\n\r\n> Several people who have contributed think they've earned zero, since all their contributions were in a single day and they never saw an update.\r\n\r\nTo address the issues brought up by @dhimmel I propose the following:\r\n\r\n1. When a user posts a comment we will make it more clear that it is 'payment eligible' (right now it is stated in small gray text), and perhaps provide a link to more information on what that means.\r\n2. The first time a user has a payment eligible comment that has been rated positively we will send them an email saying something like \"Congratulations, one of your ThinkLab comments has been rated positively and you've begun earning money!\" (I feel this is a great idea!)\r\n3. I've gone ahead and updated the \"[your points](http://thinklab.com/account/your-points)\" and \"[your comments](http://thinklab.com/account/your-comments)\" pages to try and clarify things and show the user if they have payment eligible comments.",
