I will develop an information extraction workflow using crowdsourcing and integrate machine learning methods for automated pattern recognition. This will allow a higher number of documents to be processed than what is possible with crowdsourcing alone at a quality higher than what is currently possible with automated programs. Applying the hybrid method to the literature surrounding CML and Bcr-Abl will answer the following two questions: 1) What are the limitations of existing automated information extraction programs? 2) What are previously unidentified targets of Bcr-Abl? Researchers in the natural language processing and drug discovery domains have long sought answers to these questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 id=\"specific-aims\">Specific Aims</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Aim 1: Validate non-expert information extraction ability</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The first step to developing a hybrid information extraction technique is to demonstrate that non-experts can read and interpret scientific publications. This step is necessary to ensure that the assertions extracted by the system can be trusted, a common problem in interpreting output of purely automated methods. In preliminary experiments we have determined that the pooled judgments of six non-experts is almost as accurate as domain experts at identifying biological concepts in text (<a href=\"#proof\">Figure 2a</a>). On a more complex task of determining chemical-induced diseases, we found that using as few as four non-experts already gave accuracies of 65% (<a href=\"#proof\">Figure 2b</a>), demonstrating that non-experts can interpret publications with little training. I will expand the difficulty and variety of tasks, and continue to evaluate worker performance by comparing performance to gold standards produced by expert biocurators.</p>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"proof\"></a><div class=\"figure\" figure-id=\"proof\"><div class=\"figure-content\"><img src=\"http://think-lab.s3.amazonaws.com/m/figures/17.png\"></div>\n            <div class=\"signature-1\">\n                <div class=\"figure-title\">Figure 2. Non-experts can interpret biomedical text.</div>\n                <div class=\"figure-description\"><p><strong>a)</strong> Non-expert performance on a disease annotation task steadily improves as the number of workers increases, eventually reaching that of a domain expert. <strong>b)</strong> On a more complex chemical-disease relation identification task, non-experts found 56% of relations picked by experts, but 75% of the predictions were correct, leading to a overall performance of 65%.</p></div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\r\n\r\n<h3>Aim 2: Integrate machine learning with a crowdsourcing workflow</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Although preliminary studies have shown that ML techniques can be used to resolve judgment disagreements better than majority voting (<a href=\"#machine_learn\">Figure 3a</a>), how the approaches can be used to complement one another is still mostly unknown, as the two approaches have historically been used independently <span class=\"citation\">[<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-36406-8_1\" class=\"citation\" data-key=\"10.1007/978-3-642-36406-8_1\">16</a>]</span>. To address this question, I will perform experiments attempting to fuse the two techniques together in novel ways in order to utilize the strengths of each technique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this aim, I will identify areas where predictive classifiers would provide an advantage over currently used methods. Our preliminary experiments show that task allotment and judgment aggregation would benefit from enhanced modelling. I will apply standard classifiers trained on crowd gathered data and compare whether performance or scalability increased. As a control, I will perform the same tasks with no classifiers. I expect that classifier application will enhance performance and increase the number of documents which can be processed, but that these improvements will be partially dependent upon the consistency of the human judgments.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Aim 3: Identify downstream protein targets of Bcr-Abl</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I will answer the following question: which cytoplasmic proteins in the literature are likely downstream targets of Bcr-Abl? To address this question, I will apply the hybrid information extraction system to documents related to Bcr-Abl to produce a knowledge network centered around the protein.</p>\r\n\r\n<a name=\"machine_learn\"></a><div class=\"figure\" figure-id=\"machine_learn\">\n                <table class=\"full-width\" style=\"table-layout: fixed;\"><tr><td style=\"width:50%\">\n                    <div class=\"figure-content\"><img src=\"http://think-lab.s3.amazonaws.com/m/figures/18.png\"></div>\n                </td><td style=\"width:50%\">\n                    \n            <div class=\"signature-2\">\n                <div class=\"figure-title\">Figure 3.

      "body_md": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a disorder of uncontrolled leukocyte proliferation caused by a chromosome translocation resulting in Bcr-Abl, a constitutively active tyrosine kinase [@10.1002/ajh.24221 @10.1126/science.2406902]. Over a thousand Americans die from CML each year due to resistance to existing therapies like imatinib [@cancer_facts @kimura2015 @10.2174/1568009615666150921141004]. Difficulties in selectively inhibiting Bcr-Abl have shifted drug development towards targeting downstream Bcr-Abl interactors, many of which are still unknown [@thielen2011]. Identifying new Bcr-Abl targets would spur drug development and lead to novel CML treatments.\r\n\r\n[:figure](proposal)\r\n\r\nInformatics techniques utilizing knowledge networks built from the biomedical literature have successfully identified novel p53 kinases and prostate cancer drugs [@10.4137/CIN.S13889 @10.1145/2623330.2623667]. By exhaustively processing millions of documents, informatics techniques discover insights previously missed by individual scientists. However, existing computer programs cannot extract a significant portion of important information due to limitations like being able to only process individual sentences [@10.1016/j.jbi.2014.05.013]. Improvements to processing programs would increase the breadth and depth of extractable information [@10.1007/s11390-010-9313-5 @10.1186/gb-2008-9-s2-s7]. Crowdsourcing, an approach using groups of untrained experts to perform complex tasks, has been applied to predict protein and mRNA structure and mine biomedical text [@10.1073/pnas.1313039111 @10.1038/nature09304 @10.1093/bioinformatics/btt333]. Machine learning (ML) is an analytical technique that allows programs, or classifiers, to infer patterns from provided data [@alpaydin2014].\r\n\r\n\r\nI propose to identify cytoplasmic Bcr-Abl targets using an informatics technique combining crowdsourcing and automated text mining ([Figure {n}](#proposal)). I will develop an information extraction workflow using crowdsourcing and integrate machine learning methods for automated pattern recognition. This will allow a higher number of documents to be processed than what is possible with crowdsourcing alone at a quality higher than what is currently possible with automated programs. Applying the hybrid method to the literature surrounding CML and Bcr-Abl will answer the following two questions: 1) What are the limitations of existing automated information extraction programs? 2) What are previously unidentified targets of Bcr-Abl? Researchers in the natural language processing and drug discovery domains have long sought answers to these questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Specific Aims\r\n\r\n### Aim 1: Validate non-expert information extraction ability\r\nThe first step to developing a hybrid information extraction technique is to demonstrate that non-experts can read and interpret scientific publications. This step is necessary to ensure that the assertions extracted by the system can be trusted, a common problem in interpreting output of purely automated methods. In preliminary experiments we have determined that the pooled judgments of six non-experts is almost as accurate as domain experts at identifying biological concepts in text ([Figure {n}a](#proof)). On a more complex task of determining chemical-induced diseases, we found that using as few as four non-experts already gave accuracies of 65% ([Figure {n}b](#proof)), demonstrating that non-experts can interpret publications with little training. I will expand the difficulty and variety of tasks, and continue to evaluate worker performance by comparing performance to gold standards produced by expert biocurators.\r\n\r\n\r\n[:figure](proof)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Aim 2: Integrate machine learning with a crowdsourcing workflow\r\nAlthough preliminary studies have shown that ML techniques can be used to resolve judgment disagreements better than majority voting ([Figure {n}a](#machine_learn)), how the approaches can be used to complement one another is still mostly unknown, as the two approaches have historically been used independently [@10.1007/978-3-642-36406-8_1]. To address this question, I will perform experiments attempting to fuse the two techniques together in novel ways in order to utilize the strengths of each technique.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this aim, I will identify areas where predictive classifiers would provide an advantage over currently used methods. Our preliminary experiments show that task allotment and judgment aggregation would benefit from enhanced modelling. I will apply standard classifiers trained on crowd gathered data and compare whether performance or scalability increased. As a control, I will perform the same tasks with no classifiers. I expect that classifier application will enhance performance and increase the number of documents which can be processed, but that these improvements will be partially dependent upon the consistency of the human judgments.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Aim 3: Identify downstream protein targets of Bcr-Abl\r\nI will answer the following question: which cytoplasmic proteins in the literature are likely downstream targets of Bcr-Abl? To address this question, I will apply the hybrid information extraction system to documents related to Bcr-Abl to produce a knowledge network centered around the protein.\r\n\r\n[:figure](machine_learn)\r\n\r\nI will then overlay known Bcr-Abl targets and known non-targets with the extracted information graph, and use concept similarities and term connectivities to rank potential proteins based on their resemblance to known Bcr-Abl targets. For validation, I will ask a group of blinded clinicians to review the predictions based on the original supporting literature documents and judge for prediction validity.
