The NISCAIR assigns ISSN number to all the journals in India and the list that is uploaded on their site at <a href=\"http://nsl.niscair.res.in/issn.jsp\">http://nsl.niscair.res.in/issn.jsp</a> would be used for the database development. All the information related to the journals viz., year of start, language, place (city), publishers, print only, closed access, open access, license, urls, etc which are required to make it a robust database would be collected and collated and made available. It is also planned  to integrate the database with Sherpa/RoMEO which keeps the record of publishers copyright policies. The list of ISSN Journals can be accessed at the link <a href=\"https://goo.gl/CGck6B\">https://goo.gl/CGck6B</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: If anyone wish to be part of this project, he/she may add details at the link <a href=\"https://goo.gl/QZd2Y6\">https://goo.gl/QZd2Y6</a></p>",

All the data would be shared via CC-BY and a portal would be developed for the Indian Scholars to choose and learn about the Journals and their policies.
