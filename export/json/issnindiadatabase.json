All the information related to the journals viz., year of start, language, place (city), publishers, print only, closed access, open access, license, urls, etc which are required to make it a robust database would be collected and collated and made available. It is also planned  to integrate the database with Sherpa/RoMEO which keeps the record of publishers copyright policies.
